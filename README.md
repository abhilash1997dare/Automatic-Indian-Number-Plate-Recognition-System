  Automatic Indian number plate recognition (ANPR) is a real time embedded system which automatically recognizes the license number of vehicles.The task of recognizing number plate for Indian conditions is considered, where number plate standards are rarely followed. The system consists of integration of algorithms like: 'feature-based number plate localization' for locating the number plate, 'image scissoring' for character segmentation and statistical feature extraction for character recognition; which are specifically designed for Indian number plates. The system can recognize single and double line number plates under widely varying illumination conditions with a success rate of about 82%.
